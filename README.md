## FoodDemandForecast  
*Predicting optimal food supply needs using Gradient Boosting to reduce waste.*  

## 🔍 Overview  
A machine learning model that forecasts food demand based on:  
- Historical donation quantities  
- Food waste rates  

**Goal:** Help food banks/grocers **minimize surplus** and **maximize impact**.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Gradient Boosting Regressor
